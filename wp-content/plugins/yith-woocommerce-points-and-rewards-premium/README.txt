YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards allows you to add a rewarding program to your site and encourage your customers collecting points.

== Description ==

Have you ever started collecting shopping points? What was your reaction? Most of us are really motivated in storing as many points as possible, because so we can get more and often we do not care about spending more because, if we do, we can have a better reward. Hasn't this happened to you too? That's what you get by putting into your site a point and reward programme: loyalising your customers, encouraging them to buy always from your shop and being rewarded for their loyalty.
If you think that reward programmes were only prerogative of big shopping centres or supermarkets, you're have to change your mind, because now you can add such a programme to your own e-commerce shop too. How? Simple, with YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards: easy to setup and easy to understand for your customers!


== Installation ==
Important: First of all, you have to download and activate WooCommerce plugin, which is mandatory for YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards to be working.

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards` from Plugins page.
