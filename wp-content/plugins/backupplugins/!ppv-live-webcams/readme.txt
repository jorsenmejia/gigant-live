= Hosting Requirements =
This plugin has [requirements](https://videowhisper.com/?p=Requirements "Live Streaming Requirements") beyond regular WordPress hosting specifications: a [RTMP host](https://hostrtmp.com/ "RTMP Hosting") is needed for persistent connections to manage live interactions and video streaming. Advanced features like transcoding and HLS/MPEG-Dash live video delivery, country access restrictions involve specific hosting requirements. More details about this, including solutions are provided on the Installation section pages.

= How it Works =
Performers join to earn money. They turn on their webcams and hang out in public rooms waiting for members to chat.  Performers are listed on a page (live performers show first) and site visitors can join them.

Paying clients can invite performers to do private video chat shows and pay per minute. They first need to register as clients and add some money to their virtual wallet on site to be able to request private shows.

Payments go from clients to site ownerâ€™s account depending on billing gateway (multiple supported).  Site owner can see earnings for each performer and send payments as necessary.

= Billing =
Clients can prepay credits that can be used for ppv chat. Billing is supported with TeraWallet (WooCommerce Wallet) and/or myCRED plugin that includes PayPal Standard, Skrill (Moneybookers), NETbilling, Zombaio, BitPay (bitcoin).  Other payment modules are available for extra: 2checkout, ComproPago, CoinBase, CoinPayments, PayFast, Payza, Robokassa, Stripe, WePay.
WooWallet supports free and premium payment gateways: PayPal (Standard, Checkout), Stripe (CC, Apple Pay, Google Pay, SEPA, Bancontact, Sofort, Giropay, EPS, iDeal, Przelewy24, Alipay, Multibanco),  Square (CC U.S, Canada, Australia, Japan and the UK), Amazon Pay, PayFast, Venmo, eWay (SG, MY, HK, AU, NZ), Klarna (now, later, slice), Authorize.Net, SagePay (UK), WorldPay, 2 Checkout.
