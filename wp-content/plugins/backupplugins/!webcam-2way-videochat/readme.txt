= Special Requirements =
This plugin has requirements beyond regular WordPress hosting specifications: a RTMP host is needed for persistent connections to manage live interactions and streaming. P2P can be used for the streaming when appropriate (users in same or close networks) but RTMP is always required. More details about this, including solutions, are provided on the Installation section pages.
